# UCLA CS 111 Lab 1c testing script, written by Zhaoxing Bu (zbu@cs.ucla.edu)

# to reader: please read the entire script carefully

# students can work in a team of two, you only need to write down the score for
# the student who submit the assignmet. in your score file sent back to us,
# please make sure that you have a column storing this student's teammate's UID,
# thus we can give his/her partner score by the UID column.

# 3 test cases, each for 10 points
# no partial credit, students get either 10 or 0
# please do not run multiple testing scripts at the same time
# only run this on lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu please
# REMEMBER to execute PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH in shell to call
# the correct gcc for compiling students' work
# this PATH change is restored after logging out
# this script automatically changes the PATH value for you
# but I do not guarantee it works, but if should work ;-)
# any comments, suggestions, problem reports are greatly welcomed
