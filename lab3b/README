Included in this tarball:
							lab3b.py
							README
							Makefile
							
The commands in the Makefile are:
	make
				this just tells you to run "make run" to run python script
	
	make run
				will run "python lab3b.py"
				NOTE: requires the six .csv files assumed to be present to be present
			
	make clean
				removes the tarball and the lab3b_check.txt files
				
	make dist
				makes the tarball with the files included above
				
NOTE:
	the sample solution appears not to use the indirect blocks as evidenced from the fact that
	when implemented with indirect blocks I get a different solution.  This contradicts the specs (or
	I made a silly mistake).  From my understanding from nongnu the first twelve blocks are direct,
	then blocks 13 - 268 are in the singly-indirect, 269 - 65804 in the doubly-indirect, and 65805 to
	a really large number in the trebly-indirect. The number of blocks for inode 37201 is listed as 37;
	however, only 24 are listed in the indirect.csv, hence only 36 are listed, while this error (if it
	is one) is not listed on the official sample solution .txt file.  Thus I erased my partially completed
	indirect solutions, and commented out the completed ones.
