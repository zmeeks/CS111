Included in this tarball:
							lab4_uno.c
							lab4_deux.c
							lab4_tres.c
							lab4_1.log
							lab4_2.log
							lab4_3.log
							README
							Makefile
							
The commands in the Makefile are:
	make:
			makes the three .c files
			
	make check:
			runs all three executables. 
			however, preferred method of execution is individually (please see below)
			
	make run_1
			runs lab4_1 executable (exec corresponding to lab4_uno.c)
			
	make run_2
			runs lab4_2 executable (exec corresponding to lab4_deux.c)
			
	make run_3
			runs lab4_3 executable (exec corresponding to lab4_tres.c)
			
	make clean
			removes the tarball, execuatables, and log files
				
	make dist
			makes the tarball with the files included above
			
Note:
		It is not necessary to run "make clean" between runs as the creation of the
		log files includes the flag O_TRUNC
		
Note: 
		lab4_3 would run for close to an hour and then encounter a broken pipe error so 
		the log file for that one was terminated by me pressing ctrl+c.  I believe this
		error was caused by the restarting of the server due to high demand or regular 
		restart intervals
